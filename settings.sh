# Admin-only settings transfer for Mars Launcher via adb.
# Moves the launcher's settings JSON between the device and this machine so a
# known-good configuration can be backed up and pushed onto another install.
#
# In the launcher (private Mars apps must be unlocked first), type into the app
# search field:
#   #exportsettings   dump current settings to the device
#   #importsettings   load settings from the device (then restart the launcher)
#
# Usage:
#   ./settings.sh pull [file]   copy settings off the device (default: mars_settings.json)
#   ./settings.sh push [file]   copy settings onto the device, ready for #importsettings
